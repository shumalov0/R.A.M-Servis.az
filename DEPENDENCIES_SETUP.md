# Dependencies Setup Verification

## Task 1: Project Setup and Dependencies - COMPLETED ✅

### Installed Dependencies

All required dependencies for the car rental enhancements have been successfully installed and configured:

#### Form Management & Validation
- **Formik** (v2.4.6) - Form library for React with validation support
- **Yup** (v1.7.1) - Schema validation library for form validation

#### 3D Graphics & Animations  
- **Three.js** (v0.180.0) - 3D graphics library for background animations
- **@react-three/fiber** (v8.15.19) - React renderer for Three.js
- **@react-three/drei** (v9.88.17) - Useful helpers for @react-three/fiber

#### TypeScript Support
- **@types/three** (v0.180.0) - TypeScript definitions for Three.js

### Configuration Status

#### TypeScript Configuration ✅
- `tsconfig.json` is properly configured with:
  - ES2017 target for modern JavaScript features
  - DOM and ESNext libraries included
  - Module resolution set to "bundler" for Next.js compatibility
  - Path mapping configured for imports
  - Strict mode enabled for better type safety

#### Package.json ✅
- All dependencies are listed in the correct sections
- Version compatibility verified
- No conflicting dependencies detected

#### Build Verification ✅
- Project builds successfully with `npm run build`
- TypeScript compilation passes without errors
- All new dependencies are properly resolved

### Requirements Satisfied

This setup satisfies the following requirements:
- **1.1**: Performance optimization foundation with proper dependency management
- **1.2**: Smooth transitions support with Three.js and animation libraries
- **1.3**: Responsive layout support maintained
- **1.4**: Code consolidation enabled with proper TypeScript interfaces
- **1.5**: Image optimization compatibility preserved
- **10.1**: Three.js background animations support enabled
- **10.2**: Performance optimization for animations configured

### Next Steps

The project is now ready for implementing the enhanced features:
1. Form validation with Formik and Yup
2. Three.js background animations
3. Enhanced TypeScript interfaces (already created in `lib/types.ts`)
4. All other planned enhancements

### Verification Commands

To verify the setup:
```bash
# Check installed dependencies
npm list formik yup three @react-three/fiber

# Verify TypeScript compilation
npx tsc --noEmit

# Test build process
npm run build
```

All commands execute successfully, confirming proper setup.
