# ThreeBackground Component Integration

## Overview
The ThreeBackground component has been successfully enhanced and integrated into the main layout to provide sophisticated 3D background animations using Three.js with multiple scene types and advanced performance detection.

## Integration Details

### Location
- **Component**: `components/ThreeBackground.tsx`
- **Integration**: `app/layout.tsx`

### Z-Index Layering
- The component uses `z-index: -1` to ensure it stays behind all content
- Positioned with `fixed inset-0` to cover the entire viewport
- Uses `pointer-events-none` to prevent interaction interference
- Added `role="presentation"` for better accessibility

### Scene Types Available
1. **Minimal Scene**: Very subtle background effect with gentle rotation (2% opacity)
2. **Particles Scene**: Animated floating particles with configurable count and movement
3. **Geometric Scene**: Wireframe geometric shapes with rotation animations

### Enhanced Performance Detection
- **WebGL Capabilities**: Detects GPU renderer and capabilities
- **Device Memory**: Checks available RAM (if supported)
- **CPU Cores**: Considers hardware concurrency
- **Network Speed**: Factors in connection quality
- **Mobile Detection**: Reduces performance score for mobile devices
- **Reduced Motion**: Respects user's accessibility preferences
- **Dynamic Scoring**: Calculates performance level based on multiple factors

### Performance Optimizations
- **Adaptive Rendering**: Adjusts particle count and effects based on device capabilities
- **Reduced Motion Support**: Forces minimal scene when user prefers reduced motion
- **Dynamic Canvas Settings**: Adjusts DPR, antialiasing, and power preference based on performance
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup and efficient geometry handling
- **Hydration Safe**: Prevents rendering until component is mounted
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for WebGL extension failures

### Configuration Options
```tsx
interface ThreeBackgroundProps {
  scene?: 'particles' | 'geometric' | 'minimal';
  intensity?: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
  color?: string;
  responsive?: boolean;
}
```

Current settings in layout:
```tsx
<ThreeBackground 
  scene="minimal" 
  intensity="low" 
  responsive={true}
/>
```

### Responsive Behavior
- **High Performance**: Up to 1000 particles, higher opacity, antialiasing enabled
- **Medium Performance**: 500 particles, medium opacity, balanced settings
- **Low Performance**: 200 particles, minimal opacity, optimized settings
- **Mobile Optimization**: Automatically reduces complexity on mobile devices

### Browser Support
- **WebGL Detection**: Graceful fallback for unsupported browsers
- **Extension Support**: Safe handling of WebGL debug extensions
- **Transparent Background**: Seamless integration with existing design
- **Cross-browser Compatibility**: Tested rendering contexts

### Accessibility Features
- **Reduced Motion**: Automatically switches to minimal scene
- **ARIA Labels**: Proper `aria-hidden` and `role` attributes
- **Performance Consideration**: Respects user's device limitations
- **Non-intrusive**: Doesn't interfere with keyboard navigation or screen readers
